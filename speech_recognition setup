1. go to https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/ and install the speech_recognition python module.
  along side pyaudio 2 and the other required python libraries
  

2. Enter sudo pip install --ignore-installed google-api-python-client   to install google_cloud client. 
   You'd need it to send preferred dictionary of words to google.

  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the location of this file.
   
3. Go to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/speech_recognition and open the __init__.py file

4. Search for the phrase "SpeechContext" and change it to "SpeechContexts".

5. Save it and voila, you can run the example scripts on the speech_recognition library website to
   use google's service to perform speech recognition
